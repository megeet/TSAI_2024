I want you to create two modules:
1. The first module will use react and it will contain all code for front end. The module name could be processor-augmenter-frontend
2. The second module is a python module with Fast API support. The module name could be processor-augmenter-backend

Please find below the functionality I want to have. 
Keep the front end and backend files as mentioned in above modules accordingly.
- I want to have a home page where I should be able to select file type I want to upload. It could be simple button.
- I want to support four types of files - Text, Image, Audio and 3D
- Once I click on "Text" Button, it should open a new page where I have three sections.
	- The first section is to upload a text file and show it's contents as well.
	- The second section is to process the text file,
	- The third section is to augment the file
	These sections could be columnar.
