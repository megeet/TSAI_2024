Transcript for Tira Beauty Clean Filter Chrome Extension

We all shop for makeup online these days, however, don't we always want to prefer the products that are chemical free? Every time we visit a website, it does provide you the filters to select clean or vegan products, however what if we get this functionality out of the box? We have created a chrome extension which will enhance your shopping experience by automatically applying the filter and showing only "clean" products on Tira Beauty website.

Don't worry, if you want to see all products, you can disable this extension as well.
Let's try it out. I am going to enable this extension and visit some make up sections.

In the "Conscious" filter, youâ€™ll find options like "Cruelty-Free," "Clean," and "Vegan." The enabled extension automatically applies the "Clean" filter, showing products accordingly.


Disabling the extension restores the original product list.


Enjoy your shopping with Tira Beauty, and thank you for using our Clean Filter Extension!
